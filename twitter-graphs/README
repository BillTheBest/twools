twitterRelationGraphs.py

This utility is designed to extract the follower or friend graph from a set of users using
a wrapper to the Twitter API. This utility can extract the graph and the tweets of the followers as
well. This utility is designed to obey Twitter API rate limits of the REST API. Therefore, it will sleep
the script once the rate limit is hit each hour.

I. Requirements
____________

Python 2.7.1.
	-There are 3 modules required (Tested Vers):
		1. httplib2 (0.7.1) 
		   -http://httplib2.googlecode.com/
		2. oauth2 (build 170) 
		   -https://github.com/simplegeo/python-oauth2
		3. python-twitter (0.8.2 modified READ below) 
		   -http://code.google.com/p/python-twitter/

Python 2.6.7
	- Need above and ...
		4. Argparser (1.2.1) 
		   -http://argparse.googlecode.com/

Modified 'twitter.py'
	-This module has been modified for two features
		1. Status::NewFromJsonDict has been modified to parse down the 'geo' JSON subtree to get coordinates 
		2. API:GetFollowers has been modified to accept a user parameter, rather just the api's self

____________
II. Installation & Setup
____________

1. Install the required modules:
	- Run these two commands in each of the module directories:
		% python setup.py build
		% python setup.py install
	
	NOTE: We are using a modified version of python-twitter. Therefore, if you are downloading the
		  python-twitter module from its source depo, make sure you copy over the modified twitter.py
		  from this repository or manually modify twitter.py yourself. In order to install the modified version,
		  the copy must sit in 'build/lib/' of the twitter-python folder.

2. Acquire an Authorization Key:
	- Register an application at https://dev.twitter.com (Under 'My Applications')
	- Generate the access tokens
	- Create a key file (ex: autho-keys.txt ). The file will contain exactly 4 lines:
		
		<Consumer key>
		<Consumer secret>
		<Access token>
		<Access token secret>
		
		NOTE: Do not add any additional words or characters other than the keys.

3. Acquire a list of users:
	- Create a users file (ex: mytwitterusers.txt )
	- The file has one user (ID or SN) on each line

____________
III. Run the script
____________

Help:
% python twitterRelationGraphs.py -h
	- This will show you all the parameters you may tweak

Only Follower Graph:
% python twitterRelationGraphs.py -k autho-keys.txt -u mytwitterusers.txt -f followers.graph

Only Friends Graph:
% python twitterRelationGraphs.py -k autho-keys.txt -u mytwitterusers.txt -f friends.graph

Follower Graph and Follower Tweaks:
% python twitterRelationGraphs.py -k autho-keys.txt -u mytwitterusers.txt -f followers.graph followers.tweets

Tweets of Users:
% python twitterRelationGraphs.py -k autho-keys.txt -u mytwitterusers.txt -t users.tweets
____________
III. Additional Helper Scripts
____________

twitterAccuResults.py 
-This script is only a helper script in case you are processing a large set of users and the main script
 fails prematurely.

Example:
% twitterAccuResults.py mytwitterusers.txt followers.graph.complete followers.graph	

What is happening...?
	1. This script will look at the 'followers.graph' file and find the "last user" that was processed.
	2. It will then remove all users processed before the "last user", including the last user from
	   mytwitterusers.txt.
	3. Then it will append 'followers.graph' to 'followers.graph.complete'; create 'followers.graph.complete'
	   if it does not exist already.
	4. Now you can rerun the original script with its old paramets to resume since where the script broke.

NOTE: You are supplying 3 parameters to twitterAccuResults.py. It is a dumb script that does not do
	  any write protection or safety checks. BE CAREFUL or write your own.

____________
IV. Other Information
____________

Logs:
	-Logs of processed users and unprocessable users are stored in the same base foler as the user input file

Twitter Parameters:
	-The default parameters that can be viewed using -h are set to help obtain "important" followers. 
	 Current research has found that users with over 1000 followers tend to be bots, news media, or celebrities
	 Also, there is a maximum number of 200 tweets that be extracted at one time using the Twitter API.

Twitter API Rate Limits:
	- https://dev.twitter.com/docs/rate-limiting
	- Essentially, if you have different IPs, you can make up to 350 API calls an hour.
